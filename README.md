## Part 1: Bootstrap Grid
__Edit exercise.html for this portion of the lab__
1. Create a table layout **using bootrstrap grid** that includes 3 types of animals of your choice. The table layout should look similar to this **for all types of screens**: 

| Name       | Image  |
| ------------- | -----|
| Cat     | <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YCaGYUIfdy4/maxresdefault.jpg" width="350"> |
| Red Panda     | <img src="https://i.redd.it/0vbx9fw2hpd01.jpg" width="350"> |
| Dolphin     | <img src="https://i0.wp.com/funkidsjokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dolphin-203875_960_720.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1" width="350"> |
2. Show your work to an instructor or TA!

**Bonus**
Open the website you made then right click and inspect element. As you notice, the image isn't compatible with the screen size and can sometimes get out of the borders of the column that includes it. Google how to fix that. (hint: you need to make the image's width compatible with its parent)


## Part 2: Bootstrap Components
